## Interpretation of the Deformation Field Φ

Φ(t) is an effective geometric deformation term entering the Friedmann equation.

It is not a fluid with independent conservation, but a derived scalar capturing
backreaction, geometric deformation, or effective stress from non-Einsteinian dynamics.

Φ contributes to expansion through:
H^2 = (8πG/3)ρ + Φ

Its evolution is governed by:
Φ̇ + 3HΦ = α H^2 + β Ḣ

Special cases:
α = β = 0 recovers standard FLRW.
Φ = const mimics a cosmological constant.
