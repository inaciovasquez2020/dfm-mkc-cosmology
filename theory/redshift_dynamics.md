Redshift-Form Dynamics

Redshift:
1 + z = a0 / a

Time–redshift relation:
dt/dz = -1 / ((1+z) H)

Energy densities:
rho_i(z) = rho_i0 (1+z)^{3(1+w_i)}

Friedmann constraint:
H^2 = (8πG/3) rho + Phi

Hubble evolution:
dH/dz = (1/(1+z)) * [4πG (rho + p)/H - (Phi + alpha H^2 + beta dH/dt)/(2H)]

Deformation field evolution:
dPhi/dz = (1/(1+z)) * [3 Phi - (alpha H^2 + beta dH/dt)]

System closure:
p_i = w_i rho_i
