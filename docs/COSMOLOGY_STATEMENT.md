Cosmology Statement (DFM–MKC)

Claim
Under standard cosmological assumptions (homogeneous and isotropic background, metric gravity, covariant conservation of stress energy, and a single additional dark sector described by a minimal kinetic coupling), the DFM–MKC model yields background and linear perturbation evolution consistent with current large scale structure and expansion data within stated parameter ranges. Deviations beyond the quoted confidence bounds require violation of at least one assumption listed below or the presence of additional non modeled components.

Assumptions
A1 Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker background geometry
A2 Metric gravity with covariant conservation of total stress energy
A3 Single dark fluid sector with minimal kinetic coupling as defined in this repository
A4 Linear perturbation theory valid on the scales used for comparison
A5 Standard treatment of baryons radiation and neutrinos within their established regimes
A6 Observational inputs are within their published systematics and calibration bounds

What would falsify this
F1 Background inconsistency
A statistically significant mismatch with expansion history observables that cannot be absorbed by parameter variation within the stated model

F2 Perturbation instability
Demonstration of gradient ghost or runaway instabilities in the linear perturbation sector within the allowed parameter domain

F3 Structure growth anomaly
A measured growth rate or clustering signal inconsistent with the model predictions at significance exceeding the quoted bounds

F4 Conservation violation
Evidence that the effective stress energy evolution implied by the model violates covariant conservation under the stated assumptions

F5 Degeneracy collapse
A demonstrated inability to distinguish the model from standard ΛCDM once full observational covariance is accounted for

Where the code fits
This repository provides the numerical solvers parameter scans and comparison pipelines used to evaluate the above claim against cosmological observables. The code exists to make the claim checkable and reproducible, not to restate it.

One worked implication
Implication
Within the stated assumptions, the DFM–MKC parameter space admits regions where the inferred matter clustering amplitude and expansion history remain jointly stable, tightening the allowed uncertainty on dark sector dynamics without introducing additional free components.
