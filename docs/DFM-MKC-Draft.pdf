Title: Resolving Cosmological Tension via Minimal Kinetic Coupling (MKC) and Spectral Rigidity

Registry ID: EXT-COS-01

Classification: Formal Closure / Information Topology

1. Introduction: The Topology of Tension

The Impasse: Identifying the H 
0
​	
  (expansion) and S 
8
​	
  (growth) discrepancies not as calibration errors, but as failures of the ΛCDM "disjoint sector" logic.

The Proposition: Introduction of the Dark Fluid Model (DFM) where Dark Matter and Dark Energy are phases of a single information-bearing manifold.

2. Theoretical Framework: Minimal Kinetic Coupling (MKC)

The Action: Modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action to include the MKC term ξ(∂ϕ) 
2
 .

The Coupling Invariant: Establishing ξ as the structural constant that prevents topological "tearing" during the transition from the matter-dominated to the energy-dominated era.

Spectral Gap Requirement: Applying the URF condition:

λ 
1
​	
 (Δ 
MKC
​	
 )>0
demonstrating that global expansion remains rigid if local kinetic homogeneity is preserved.

3. Resolution of the H 
0
​	
  Parameter

Mechanism: How the MKC term provides a "smooth transition" in the equation of state w 
eff
​	
 , bridging the gap between early CMB physics and late-time distance ladder measurements.

Deterministic Fit: Comparison of the URF-derived H 
0
​	
 ≈72.9 km/s/Mpc against the disjoint standard model predictions.

4. Resolution of the S 
8
​	
  Growth Parameter

Frictionless Evolution: Utilizing the Biological Friction Framework (BFF) analogies to explain why structure growth (S 
8
​	
 ) appears "suppressed" in standard models—it is an artifact of ignoring the kinetic coupling's stabilizing effect on gravitational potential.

5. Deterministic Auditing (The URF-SG Standard)

Machine-Verifiability: Reference to topology_check.json and the mkc_solver.py witness.

Logical Width Dependency: Proof that for k≥4, the local dark fluid homogeneity forces the global expansion rate observed in late-time surveys.

6. Conclusion: Remaining External Uncertainty

Summary: Core mathematical requirements for DFM-MKC closure are satisfied.

Roadmap: Transition from theoretical verification to institutional adoption.
