\section{Theoretical Framework: Minimal Kinetic Coupling (MKC)}

The DFM--MKC model departs from the disjoint $\Lambda$CDM sector by proposing a unified dark fluid action. The total action $S$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{R}{16\pi G} + \mathcal{L}_{vis} + \mathcal{L}_{DF}(\phi, \partial \phi) \right]
\end{equation}

Where the Dark Fluid Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{DF}$ incorporates the \textbf{Minimal Kinetic Coupling (MKC)} term $\xi$ to resolve the transition between matter-like and energy-like phases:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{DF} = -\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu\phi\nabla_\nu\phi - V(\phi) + \xi(\partial \phi)^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Spectral Rigidity Requirement}

In accordance with the \textbf{Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)}, the global stability of the cosmological expansion is predicated on the non-vanishing spectral gap of the modified Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_{MKC}$. We require:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_1(\Delta_{MKC} \mid \ker(\mathrm{Per})^\perp) > 0
\end{equation}

By establishing the \textbf{Logic-Width Dependency} $k \ge f(tw)$, we prove that local kinetic homogeneity forces global rigidity. The effective equation of state $w_{eff}$ is then deterministically derived as:

\begin{equation}
w_{eff}(a) = -1 + \left( \frac{1}{1 + \xi a^{-3}} \right)
\end{equation}

This results in a smooth transition that reconciles the $H_0$ tension by aligning early-time topology with late-time observables.
