**ORCID:** 0009-0008-8459-3400  
**Program Status:** Core Closed (External Validation Pending)

This repository is part of the public research ecosystem supporting the **Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)**.  
It documents the transition from foundational rigidity theory to executable structural artifacts, standards, and verification-ready modules.

## 🏛️ Significance Statement — The URF Closure

The **Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)** resolves a long-standing structural obstruction in finite and local reasoning systems: the inability of bounded-locality logics (e.g. FOᵏ) to enforce global structural stability in the presence of expander-type obstructions.

The core result establishes a **Logic–Width Dependency**:

\[
k \;\ge\; f(\mathrm{tw})
\]

demonstrating that beyond a critical width threshold, local homogeneity necessarily forces global rigidity. This closes the Local→Global gap under explicit, checkable structural conditions.

All internal mathematical dependencies required for this closure are complete. Any remaining uncertainty is strictly **external** (e.g. institutional verification, uptake, or independent reproduction).

## 📂 Research Ecosystem

This repository participates in a broader, modular research ecosystem. Each component is independently versioned and auditable.

| Repository | Focus | Registry ID |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **URF-Core** | Foundational Rigidity Theory | CORE-LW-01 |
| **URC-Minimal-Blockchain** | Distributed Capacity Retention | ART-BC-01 |
| **Exchange-Force** | Relational Interaction Axioms | ART-EXF-01 |
| **Biological-Friction** | Invariant-Based Complexity Limits | ART-BIO-01 |

Together, these modules form a layered progression from abstract rigidity principles to applied structural constraints.

## 📊 Technical & Verification Dashboard

For machine-verifiable artifacts, deterministic audit logs, and executable verification traces  
(including Heisenberg- and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck–type witnesses), see the:

👉 **Active Artifact Registry**

This registry provides:
- cryptographically stable artifact references,
- deterministic replay of verification steps,
- explicit separation between proven structure and contextual interpretation.

## 📁 Documentation & Draft Policy

This repository follows a **strict no-placeholder policy**:

- Draft LaTeX sources (`.tex`) and compiled PDFs (`.pdf`) are **not included** unless they contain complete, non-empty content.
- Empty or provisional artifacts are removed rather than retained as placeholders.
- Historical commits may still show earlier empty files, but these are **not part of the current main branch**.

Drafts are reintroduced **only** when:
1. the source is complete,
2. the compiled artifact is locally verified,
3. both are committed together in a single, clean change.

This policy ensures clarity for readers, reviewers, and auditors.
