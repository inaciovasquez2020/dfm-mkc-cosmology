# Inacio F. Vasquez — Independent Research Program
**Canonical Program Hub for the Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)**

**ORCID:** 0009-0008-8459-3400  
**Program Status:** Core Theory Closed / External Validation Pending

This repository is the public entry point for the **Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)** and its associated scientific infrastructure.  
It serves as the **program-level identity and routing layer** connecting foundational theory, executable verification artifacts, and institutional interfaces.

This repository does **not** introduce new theory.  
It exists to expose, index, and stabilize the scientific record.

## Significance Statement — The URF Closure

The **Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)** resolves a central obstruction in finite and local reasoning systems:  
the inability of bounded-locality logics (e.g. FOᵏ) to enforce global structural stability in the presence of expander-type obstructions.

The core result establishes the **Logic–Width Dependency**:

\[
k \;\ge\; f(\mathrm{tw})
\]

This shows that beyond a critical width threshold, local homogeneity necessarily forces global rigidity.  
The Local→Global gap is closed under explicit, checkable structural conditions.

All internal mathematical dependencies required for this closure are complete.  
Any remaining uncertainty is strictly **external** (independent verification, adoption, institutional uptake).

## Scientific Infrastructure Model

This program is implemented as a **modular scientific operating system**:

| Layer | Role |
|------|------|
| **Tier A modules** | Canonical theorems, frameworks, witnesses |
| **Verification layer** | Executable binding witnesses (CI / Lean / tests) |
| **Kernel table** | `scientific-infrastructure` manifest |
| **Public hub (this repo)** | Human interface and citation surface |
| **Journals / DOIs** | External certification layer |

This repository is the **human interface layer**.

## Technical & Verification Dashboard

Executable verification traces and deterministic audit logs are published via:

https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/dashboard.html

This registry provides:
- cryptographically stable artifact references,
- deterministic replay of verification pipelines,
- separation between proven structure and interpretation.

---

## Documentation & Draft Policy

This repository follows a **strict no-placeholder policy**:

- Draft `.tex` or `.pdf` files are not committed unless complete.
- Empty or provisional artifacts are removed rather than retained.
- Historical commits may contain drafts, but the current branch contains **only finalized artifacts**.

This ensures the public record is:
- audit-safe,
- reviewer-safe,
- and machine-indexable.

---

## Repository Role

This repository is:

- **not** a theorem repository  
- **not** a conjecture repository  
- **not** a tooling repository  

It is the **program hub**:
- citation surface,
- institutional interface,
- public identity layer.
