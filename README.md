DFM–MKC Cosmology: Dark Fluid Model with Minimal Kinetic Coupling

This repository hosts the formal submission for the Dark Fluid Model (DFM), a cosmological extension of the Lab's structural stability research. It provides a unified resolution to the H

  tension parameters by treating the dark sector as a single fluid with Minimal Kinetic Coupling (MKC).

🏛️ Significance Statement: The Tension Resolution
The DFM–MKC provides a deterministic alternative to the fragmented ΛCDM model. By introducing a single additional kinetic degree of freedom (ξ), the framework demonstrates that cosmological tensions are not observational anomalies but emergent properties of the dark sector's Information Topology. This model ensures that global expansion remains rigid across the transition from dust-like behavior to repulsive energy states.

Research Status
The mathematical derivation for the Minimal Kinetic Coupling is closed. The model successfully characterizes the Local$\to$Global expansion rate without disjoint dark sectors. Remaining uncertainty is strictly external (institutional uptake and citation).
