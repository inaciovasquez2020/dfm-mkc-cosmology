Linear Scalar Perturbations

Gauge
Newtonian gauge
ds^2 = -(1+2Psi) dt^2 + a(t)^2 (1-2Phi_N) dx^2

Background
H(z), Phi(z) from solver
rho_i(z), p_i(z) with p_i = w_i rho_i

Matter growth equation (quasi-static, subhorizon, minimal)
delta_m''(a) + [ (3/a) + (H'(a)/H(a)) ] delta_m'(a) - (3/2) (Omega_m(a)/a^2) mu(a) delta_m(a) = 0

Definitions
prime means d/da
Omega_m(a) = rho_m(a) / (3 H(a)^2 / (8 pi G))
mu(a) is effective gravitational strength modifier
Minimal choice mu(a) = 1

Optional mapping for deformation contributions
Define Omega_Phi(a) = Phi(a)/H(a)^2
Allow mu(a) = 1 + c_mu Omega_Phi(a) with c_mu constant to be constrained

Outputs
Growth factor D(a) with D(a0)=1
Growth rate f(a)=d ln D / d ln a
f sigma8 if sigma8 is supplied as nuisance parameter
